*DESCRIPTION*: 

I was assigned a task that involved designing and simulating a basic 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) entirely using Verilog/VHDL code. The ALU had to support essential operations including addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT. Working with 4-bit data width helped me focus on understanding the core structure of an ALU while still implementing meaningful arithmetic and logical behaviour. This project strengthened my understanding of digital logic design, Verilog HDL coding techniques, and the complete process of developing, testing, and verifying a hardware module using an industry-standard Electronic Design Automation (EDA) simulation tool. My goal was not only to write a correct and optimized Verilog description of the 4-bit ALU but also to create a comprehensive testbench and document the simulation results through waveform analysis. The ALU architecture consisted of two 4-bit operands, A and B, and a 3-bit opcode that controlled which operation was executed. I defined the opcode assignments as 000 for addition, 001 for subtraction, 010 for AND, 011 for OR, and 100 for the NOT operation applied on operand A. The Verilog module was written using a combinational always block so the output would immediately respond to any changes in input or opcode. Once the ALU design was complete, I developed a detailed Verilog testbench that applied multiple test cases, varied input combinations, and introduced small delays to clearly observe each output transition during simulation. For the verification and debugging phase, I extensively used the EDA simulation tool, which provided powerful features such as waveform viewing, signal tracing, cursor measurements, and hierarchical design inspection. After importing and compiling the Verilog files, I launched the simulator to observe how the ALU responded to different operations. The waveform viewer confirmed that the ALU performed correctly for all 4-bit inputs: addition produced accurate sums within the 4-bit range, subtraction behaved correctly with proper handling of binary differences, AND, OR operations generated the expected bitwise outputs, and the NOT operation correctly inverted all four bits of operand A. The EDA tool made the debugging process efficient by showing real-time updates, allowing zooming into specific time intervals, and highlighting any unexpected behaviour. I captured waveform snapshots and included them in my simulation report to document the functional correctness of the design. Working with 4-bit signals helped me clearly visualize binary transitions and understand how each bit contributes to the final output. This entire experience improved my proficiency in Verilog HDL, strengthened my foundation in digital logic concepts, and introduced me to the practical workflow used in the hardware design industry for simulation and verification. It also enhanced my ability to analyse waveforms, correct logical issues, and validate circuit behaviour using professional EDA tools. Overall, completing this project was a highly valuable learning milestone during my internship, and I would like to sincerely thank Codtech for providing me with this excellent opportunity to learn, grow, and gain real-world experience in digital electronics and hardware design.
